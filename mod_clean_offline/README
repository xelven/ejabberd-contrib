mod_clean_offline
ejabberd maintenance and operation.

Author : Allen Chan <xelven@gmail.com>

Motivation:
when I working on ejabberd and try to deploy to scalable environment,
when lot of user register but low usage there will be lot of message keeping in offline message.
I realize should be have module to house keeping those data, and log to some where.




How is works:
add in your ejabberd.cfg
{modules, [
...
{mod_clean_offline,[]},
...
]}.


now can setting to system crontab,
00 00 * * * root ejabberdctl clean_by_day  X

X is should be a number,how many day ago data.
